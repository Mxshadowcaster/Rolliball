# Rolliball
Simple rolling/flying ball game!

To Open with Unity, clone the project to your Unity project folder or personal desktop project folder.

Go into Rolliball>Assets>_Scenes>Minigame.unity 
this will open the project in the Unity editor

In the Unity editor, go to file>build settings, select a file location, and build!
To start the game, open Rolliball.exe

I used Unity's Roll-A-Ball and Adding Music to your Game tutorials as a base for this game. Links to both:
